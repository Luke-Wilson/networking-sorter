  To get the most out of a corporate lunch or dinner event, attendees need to be seated with other guests in a way to maximize networking opportunitites.

  Good event managers know this, and the often arduous task of sorting people into the best possible groups falls to them. This is a tricky task given that the event manager has to try to remember key details (such as organization, job title, level of seniority etc) about all of the attendees as he or she is sorting the event.

  Networking Sorter automates a lot of this process by doing a first-round sort of an event's attendees, creating groups in which all attendees can have the best networking experience based around their own details.
